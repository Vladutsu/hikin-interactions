      **Hutao Teams**

      Hutao/Yelan/Xingqiu/Zhongli or Kazuha

      Yelan’s hydro application is not as strong as Xingqiu for Hu Tao teams. This is because Yelan does not have orbital swords to assist in Hydro application when Hutao uses her CA on enemies. This would mean that in order to play Yelan with Hutao, you must also run Xingqiu to help maintain the hydro aura. This also allows them to do significantly more damage since Yelan and Xingqiu’s energy requirements are drastically reduced when used together. With our current understanding of how C2 functions, C2 should theoretically help reset the gauge to hydro sometimes, BUT it is not 100% consistent and Hu Tao can still overtake the hydro gauge depending on animation cancel speed, blood blossom ticks, and other various reactions that can deplete the hydro gauge.

  - title: '**Raiden Teams**'
    description: >-

      Yelan/Raiden/Anemo and-or Bennett/Flex

      Yelan has enough raw firepower to replace Sara in Raiden Hypercarry comps. Raiden serves as a potent battery for Yelan while also being a powerful on-field DPS. Raiden and Yelan also share a support in the form of a Viridescent Venerer holder like Kazuha. While Hypercarry Raiden uses Bennett and Yelan does not benefit from Bennett, this issue is negligible when considering the raw numbers for team damage, easily enough to clear Spiral Abyss.

  - title: '**Taser Teams**'

      Yelan/Electro/Anemo/Flex

      Since Yelan’s Burst procs with normal attacks, she is a strong candidate for EC teams (Sucrose/Fischl/Beidou/XQ). It must be noted that her taser teams can be more difficult compared to XQ because of the lack of healing/damage reduction.

  - title: '**Freeze Teams**'
    description: |-

      Yelan/Cryo/Anemo/Flex

      Although Yelan can apply a good amount of hydro for Freeze teams, she faces tough competition for the hydro slot. Although Yelan is not the optimal pick for Freeze teams she is still quite good for Ayaka in particular if you do not have access to Mona or Kokomi. Keep in mind that Yelan’s Breakthrough Barb is an option for applying AoE Hydro to maintain Freeze against multiple opponents.
